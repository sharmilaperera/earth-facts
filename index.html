            "Earth's crust is divided into several large and small tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid mantle, causing earthquakes and volcanic activity.",
            "Earth has a strong magnetic field generated by the movement of molten iron in its outer core, which protects the planet from harmful solar radiation.",
            "The tilt of Earth's axis (about 23.5 degrees) relative to its orbit around the Sun causes the seasons.",
